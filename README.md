# Practical_Machine_Learning

This is the repository for the Practical Machine Learning project. 

The goal of this project is to implementing machine learning algorithms for predicting if a subject is performing weight lifting exercise correctly. The Weight Lifting Exercises (WLE) dataset (source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har) is used in the project. The final chosen algorithm in this project is used to predict the outcome of 20 test cases of the Coursera Practical Machine Learning quiz. 

The project report can be viewed online here : http://mycheong.github.io/Practical_Machine_Learning/

The R markdown (PML_proj.rmd) and the compiled HTML (PML_proj.html) files are included in this repo.
